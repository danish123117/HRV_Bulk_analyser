# HRV Analyser

## Project Overview
- The **HRV Analyser** is a tool designed to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features. Currently in its **pre-alpha stage**, this project is under active development and is not yet ready for production use. In particular The frequency domain results may significantly vary from the results of other tools- particularly for long signals with significant artefacts. 
- The proper use of this tool at the current stage of development requires significant knowledge of python and an understanding of Frequency domain analysis methords in particular Welch's method and related concepts.

## Features (Planned)
- **HRV Data Cleaning**
- **Time Domain Parameters**
- **Frequency Domain Parameters**
- **Visualization Tools**
